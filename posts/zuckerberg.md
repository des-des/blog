# To Zuck

Okay everyone, so I know I promised so deeper thoughts about facebook, and what it means that it has become our defacto online space, first there is some stuff I want to get off my chest. I promise some more productive thoughts are coming soon ;)

## A message for Zucks

You have inserted yourself into my life. You read messages I send to lovers, family and friends. I never asked for this. You have done this without my consent.

You have annihilated the competition and demanded a monopoly of my thoughts. In your mission to monitise me, you have built tools for despots and facisists - you stole the keys to our democracy then put them on ebay.

As we close our libraries, as our state education system collapses under cuts, as we sell our postal service, you and the masters of this utopian information age amass wealth greater than that of billions of the poorest inhabitants of this planet.

**Where the fuck is our money?**

We did not agree to this. Where is the European facebook, where is the British facebook, where is the bristolian facebook. Where is our Baidoo. You buy our innovation then turn it on us. We have fuck all, you took it all. Our impotent govenments allow you to eat our innovation. We don't want this, we never wanted to this.

You, Mark Zuckerberg, are unloved, unliked, unelected and unfit for office. You are like a child king, bestowed powers far beyond your wisdom. You cannot be the custodian of our narrative. You cannot be the one to control our journalistic autonomy. We did not ask for this, we do not want it, **go away**.

**I did not agree to your T&Cs**.

You do not have my permission to read the messages I send to my friends.
You do not have my permission to store my location data.
You do not have my permission read the contact list on my phone.
You do not have my permission to add my to your facal recognition database.

You never did and you never will. Your not invited to my party, please just go away.

You do not have permission to profile me. You do not have permission to sell my gender, sexuality, ethnicity or politics to businesses. Nor do you have my permission to sell this data to people working with Putin, people working for Steve Bannon, people working with Boris Johnson.

I never gave this to you and I never will.

You never offered me an opt out. I just wish my government had.

### We need to work on our exit strategy
