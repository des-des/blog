# Losing our digital future

#### Eoin McCarthy | 130319

## hi there, i'm going to talk about being a in pub. i hope, that by explaining some blindingly obvious things about this pub, you will understand why we will eventually get rid of facebook.

### this is my first blog post

So me and three mates are sitting in spoons. I have a different friend is sitting in a pub in another city, I cannot hear what this other friend is saying. This is because that is how sound works. I have understood this intuitively from a young age.

The food and drinks are served by people who live in Bristol, their employment contracts are drawn up under laws created in both the UK parliament, and in Brussels. With each pint of ale that I buy, I pay tax to the UK government.

The volume at which I speak, what I talk about, and how drunk I get, are all influenced by British culture, in which I was raised.

### so far pretty obvious, right?

We can take a step back, and look further than the pub (sorry). We can look across our lives, to the connections that we build, jobs that we do, things that we buy, and see a rich tapestry of places. Parks, pubs, shops, shopping centers, our homes and those of our friends. Each one of these has its own complex relationship with the legal and social frameworks in which we live, national and international. In each one the way we behave interacts with our culture and our conditioning. Importantly, each one of these places has existed for hundreds of years.


### lets take our move from offline spaces into online spaces as a given

</br>

As we move our lives into online spaces, what are we giving away, **and what has this got to do with facebook**?

Lets look at facebook, what it is, **and what it wants to be**.

Facebook, like the notice board in cafe Kino, is a space where we advertise our local businesses.
Facebook, like the spoons I was in, is a space we we talk about politics. Facebook, like a party I was at the other night, is a place we meet new people (maybe).

Now, we know we are going to lose a lot of stuff as we move our lives online. Communicating with someone via digitised text or audio will always be different to talking to them in a pub. But what is the digital analogy of our society as it exists now? Will we exist in a multitude of different places, owned, build and controlled by many people.

When we exist on facebook, we are not allowed to see the rules of the game, we do not know who will hear what we say, or why. This is very different to a pub, when who you hear depends where you sit. There is no place in our society for a single American company that aims to replace each of our spaces, casting aside our laws, our jobs, our social conventions. **Surveillance capitalism is not the problem, it is the symptom**. I don't give a shit if facebook collects my data, the problem is that it was allowed to exist in the first place.

## We need to stop trying to regulate facebook, and work on our exit strategy

**Our online spaces need to be created by us**. The same way our offline spaces are. That is the only future that exists that is not really.

I think if legislators could see facebook as an alternative digital future - an alternative digital future where the spaces people exist in are not created by them, then they would see **it is not a good idea**.

I want to write more and think more about this, and write in more detail about the how facebook can never be force for good in our society.
